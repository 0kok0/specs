## Abstract

In this specification, we describe how to write a Status client for
communicating with other Status clients.

We present a reference implementation of the protocol <sup>1</sup> that is used
in a command line client <sup>2</sup> and a mobile app <sup>3</sup>.

This document consists of two parts. The first outlines the specifications that
have to be implemented in order to be a full Status client.
