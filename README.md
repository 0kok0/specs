| x3   | [Initial Protocol Specification](protocol.md) |
| x4   | [Initial Protocol Overview](x4.md) |
| x5   | [Initial Trust Establishment Specification](x5.md) |
| x6   | [Initial Conversational Security Specification](x6.md) |
| x7   | [Initial Transport Privacy through Whisper Specification](x7.md) |

Desired:
- Protocol overview, including payloads and specific considerations
- Trust establishment

x4-x8 is Oskar cutting things up into orthogonal pieces.
