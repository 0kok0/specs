# Abstract

Ethereum empowers users and developers to interact with totally new kind of applications called Dapps (Decentralized applications). These application allows to interact with the blockchain on a completely new level which is not only about exchanging values but also executing arbitrary logic. This logic can form very sophisticated programs like DAOs (Decentralized autonomous organizations). The missing part here is how users of Dapps can communicate securely and in a decentralized way with each other. Communication is an essential part of any activity. In this document, we specify a secure and decentralized messaging protocol that is capable of running on the Ethereum network.

# Terminology

* *Client*: a Whisper node implementing the protocol
* *Whisper node*: an Ethereum node with Whisper V6 enabled (in the case of geth, it's `--shh` option)
* *Status Whisper node*: an Ethereum node with Whisper V6 enabled and additional Whisper extensions described in [Whisper V6 extensions (or Status Whisper Node)](#whisper-v6-extensions-or-status-whisper-node)
* *Whisper network*: a group of Whisper nodes connected together through the internet connection and forming a graph
* *MailServer*: an Ethereum node with Whisper V6 enabled and a mail server registered capable of storing and providing offline messages
* *Message*: decrypted Whisper message
* *Envelope*: encrypted message with some metadata like topic and TTL sent between Whisper nodes; a symmetric or asymmetric key is needed to decrypt it and read the payload
* *Offline message*: an expired envelope stored by a Whisper node permanently

# Basic Assumption

This protocol assumes the following:
1. There MUST be an Ethereum node that is capable of discovering peers and implements Whisper V6 specification.
2. Participants of a given Whisper network in order to communicate with each other MUST accept messages with lowered PoW value. More in (Whisper node configuration)(#whisper-node-configuration).
3. Time MUST be synced between all nodes participating in the given network (this is intrinsic requirement of the Whisper specification as well). A clock drift between two peers larger than 20 seconds MAY result in discarding incoming messages.

# Protocol Overview

Notice: this protocol is documented post factum. The goal of it is to clearly present the current design and prepare the ground for its second version.

The implementation of this protocol is mainly done in https://github.com/status-im/status-react and https://github.com/status-im/status-go repositories.

The goal of this protocol is to allow people running Ethereum nodes with Whisper service enabled to exchange messages that are end-to-end encrypted in a way that guarantees [darkness to some extent](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Achieving-Darkness).

It's important to notice that messages [are not limited to be text messages](#content-types) only. They can also have special meaning depending on the client implementation. For example, in the current implementation, there are message which informs about Eth requests.

This protocol consist of three components:
* payload
* Whisper adapter
* offline messaging.

[The payload section](#payload) describes how the messages are encoded and decoded and what each fields of a message means. This is required to properly interpret messages by the client.

Whisper adapter specifies interaction with the Whisper service with regards to keys management, configuration and attaching metadata required to properly forward and process messages.

Offline messaging describes how the protocol handles delivering messages when one or more participants are offline and the messages expire in the Whisper network.

The protocol does not specify additional things like peers discovery, running Whisper nodes, underlying p2p protocols etc.

# Payload

Payload is an array of bytes exchanged between peers. In the case of this protocol, the payload is encoded using [transit format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format). It is a text-based format so even encoded version is easily readable by humans.

Payload contains the following fields:
1. text `string`
2. content type `enum { text/plain }` (more in [Content types](#content-types))
3. message type `enum { public-group-user-message, user-message, group-user-message }` (more in [Message types](#message-types))
4. clock `int64`
5. timestamp `int64`
6. content `struct { chat-id string, text string }`

Example of a valid encoded payload:

```
["~#c4",["abc123","text/plain","~:public-group-user-message",154593077368201,1545930773682,["^ ","~:chat-id","testing-adamb","~:text","abc123"]]]
```

As you can see, the message is an array and each index value has its meaning:
* 0: `c4` is a decoder handler identification for the current payload format. Identifications allow to register handlers for many different types of payload
* 1: array which items correspond to the described payload fields above

For more details regarding serialization and deserialization please consult [transit format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) specification.

## Content types

Content types are required for a proper interpretation of incoming messages. Not each message is a plain text but may carry a different information.

The following content types MUST be supported:
* `text/plain` identifies a message which content is a plain text
* `sticker` TODO
* `status` TODO
* `command` TODO
* `command-request` TODO
* `emoji` TODO

TODO: select which are required and which are client-specific.

## Message types

Message types are required to decide how a particular message is encrypted (more in [Whisper > Message encryption](#message-encryption)) and what metadata needs to be attached (more in [Whisper > Topic](#topic)) when passing a message to the transport layer.

The following messages types MUST be supported:
* `public-group-user-message` is a message to the public group
* `user-message` is a private message
* `group-user-message` is a message to the private group.

## Clock vs Timestamp and message ordering

`timestamp` MUST be Unix time calculated when the message is created. Because the peers in the Whisper network should have synchronized time, `timestamp` values should be fairly accurate among all Whisper network participants.

`clock` SHOULD be calculated using the algorithm of [Lamport timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps). When there are messages available in a chat, `clock`'s value is calculated based on the last received message in a particular chat: `last-message-clock-value + 1`. If there are no messages, `clock` is initialized with `timestamp`'s value.

`clock` value is used for the message ordering. Due to the used algorithm and distributed nature of the system, we achieve casual ordering which might produce counterintuitive results in some edge cases. For example, when one joins a public chat and sends a message before receiving the exist messages, their message `clock` value might be lower and the message will end up in the past when the historical messages are fetched.

# Whisper adapter

Whisper in version 6 has been chosen as a messages exchange protocol because it was designed as an off-chain communication layer for the Ethereum nodes. It supports e2e encryption and uses epidemic spread to route data to all members of the network. It also provides [darkness to some extent](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Achieving-Darkness).

However, using Whisper has a few tradeoffs:
* was not designed to handle huge number of messages
* was not designed to be real-time; some delays over a few seconds are expected
* does not scale well with the number of messages in the network

This protocol can operate using a Whisper service which requires this protocol implementation to run in the same process as well as Whisper's RPC API which might be provided by a separate Whisper node process via IPC or WebSocket.

There is some tight coupling between the payload and Whisper:
* Whisper message topic depends on the actual message type (see [Topic](#topic))
* Whisper message uses a different key (asymmetric or symmetric) depending on the actual message type (see [Keys management](#keys-management))

## Whisper node configuration

If you want to run a Whisper node and receive messages from Status clients, it must be properly configured.

Whisper's Proof Of Work algorithm is used to deter denial of service and various spam/flood attacks against the Whisper network. The sender of a message must perform some work which in this case means processing time. Because Status' main client is a mobile client, this easily leads to battery draining and poor performance of the app itself. Hence, all clients MUST use the following Whisper node settings:
* proof-of-work not larger than `0.002`
* time-to-live not lower than `10` (in seconds)

TODO: provide an instruction how to start a Whisper node with proper configuration using geth.

## Keys management

The protocol requires a key (symmetric or asymmetric) for the following actions:
* signing a message (a private key)
* decrypting received messages (a private key or symmetric key).

As private keys and symmetric keys are required to process incoming messages, they must be available all the time and are stored in memory.

Keys management for PFS is described in [Perfect forward secrecy section](#perfect-forward-secrecy-pfs).

## Encryption algorithms

All encryption algorithms used by Whisper should be described in the [Whisper V6 specification](http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-627).

Cryptographic algorithms used by PFS are described in [Perfect forward secrecy section](#perfect-forward-secrecy-pfs).

## Topic

There are two types of Whisper topics the protocol uses:
* static topic for `user-message` message type (also called _contact discovery topic_)
* dynamic topic based on a chat name for `public-group-user-message` message type.

The static topic is always the same and its hex representation is `0xf8946aac`. In fact, _the contact discovery topic_ is calculated using a dynamic topic algorithm described below with a constant name `contact-discovery`.

Having only one topic for all private chats has an advantage as it's very hard to figure out who talks to who. A drawback is that everyone receives everyone's messages but they can decrypt only these they have private keys for.

A dynamic topic is derived from a string using the following algorithm:

```
var hash []byte

hash = keccak256(name)

# Whisper V6 specific
var topic [4]byte

topic_len = 4

if len(hash) < topic_len {
    topic_len = len(hash)
}

for i = 0; i < topic_len; i++ {
    topic[i] = hash[i]
}
```

## Message encryption

The protocol distinguishes messages encrypted using asymmetric and symmetric encryption.

Symmetric keys are created using [`shh_generateSymKeyFromPassword`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_generatesymkeyfrompassword) Whisper V6 RPC API method which accepts one param, a string.

Messages encrypted with asymmetric encryption should be encrypted using recipient's public key so that only the recipient can decrypt them.

Encryption of messages supporting PFS is described in [Perfect Forward Secrecy](#perfect-forward-secrecy-pfs) section.

# Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

Additionally to encrypting messages on the Whisper level, the protocol supports PFS specification.

A message payload is first encrypted following the PFS specification and then it is encrypted once again following the Whisper specification and this protocol.

As not all messages are encrypted with PFS, a following strategy MAY be used:
1. First, message is decrypted on the Whisper level
2. Try to decrypt the message payload using PFS algorithm
2.1. If successful, pass the decrypted value to (3)
2.2. If failed, pass the unchanged payload to (3)
3. Decode the payload as described in [Payload](#payload) section

TODO: link to a separate document (currently in the PR).

[PFS in Status.im docs](https://status.im/research/pfs.html)

# Device syncing

TODO: link to a separate document.

# One-to-one messages

One-to-one messages are also known as private messages. These are the messages sent between two participants of the conversation.

## Sending

Sending a message is fairly easy and relies on the Whisper RPC API, however, some preparation is needed:

1. Obtain a public key of the recipient of the message
2. Add your private key to Whisper using [`shh_addPrivateKey`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_addprivatekey) and save the result as `sigKeyID`
3. Call [`shh_post`(https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_post) with the following settings:
   1. `pubKey` MUST be a hex-encoded public key of the message recipient
   2. `sig` MUST be set to `sigKeyID`
   3. `ttl` MUST be at least `10` (it is in seconds)
   4. `topic` MUST be set accordingly to [Topic](#topic) section and hex-encoded
   5. `payload` MUST be a hex-encoded string
   6. `powTime` MAY be arbitrary but should be enough to perform proof-of-work
   7. `powTarget` MUST be equal or lower than `0.002`.

Note: these instructions are for the Whisper V6 RPC API. If you use Whisper service directly or Go `shhclient`, the parameters might have different types.

Learn more following [Whisper V6 RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API).

### Sending using PFS

When one decides to use PFS, the flow is the same but the payload MUST be additionally encrypted following the [PFS specification](#pfs) before being hex-encoded and passed to `shh_post`.

## Receiving

Receiving private messages depends on Whisper filters idea. Upon receiving, messages are first matched by a topic and then trying to be decrypted using user's private key.

1. Add your private key to Whisper using [`shh_addPrivateKey`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_addprivatekey) and save the result as `sigKeyID`
2. Call [`shh_subscribe`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_subscribe) with criteria:
   1. `minPow` MUST be at least `0.002`
   2. `topics` MUST be list of hex-encoded topics you expect messages to receive from (follow [Topic](#topic) section)
   3. `allowP2P` MUST be set to `true` if offline messages are supported, otherwise can be `false`.

Alternative method is to use [`shh_newMessageFilter`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_newmessagefilter) which takes the same criteria object and then periodically calling [`shh_getFilterMessages`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_getfiltermessages) method.

Learn more following [Whisper V6 RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API).

# Public messages

Public messages are encrypted with a symmetric key which is publicly known so anyone can participate in the conversation.

The fact that anyone can participate makes the public chats vulnerable to spam attacks. Also, there are no moderators of these chats.

## Sending

1. Calculate a symmetric key using [`shh_generateSymKeyFromPassword`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_generatesymkeyfrompassword) passing a public chat name as a string and save the result to `symKeyID`
2. Call [`shh_post`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_post) with the following settings:
   1. `symKeyID` MUST be set to `symKeyID`
   2. `sig` MUST be set to `sigKeyID`
   3. `ttl` MUST be at least `10` (it is in seconds)
   4. `topic` MUST be set accordingly to [Topic](#topic) section and hex-encoded,
   5. `payload` MUST be a hex-encoded string,
   6. `powTime` MAY be arbitrary but should be enough to perform proof-of-work
   7. `powTarget` MUST be equal or lower than `0.002`.

Learn more following [Whisper V6 RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API).

## Receiving

Receiving public messages depends on Whisper filters idea. Upon receiving, messages are first matched by a topic and then trying to be decrypted using a symmetric key.

1. Calculate a symmetric key using [`shh_generateSymKeyFromPassword`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_generatesymkeyfrompassword) passing public chat name as a string and save the result to `symKeyID`
2. Call [`shh_subscribe`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_subscribe) with criteria:
   1. `minPow` MUST be at least `0.002`
   2. `topics` MUST be list of hex-encoded topics you expect messages to receive from (follow [Topic](#topic) section)
   3. `allowP2P` MUST be set to `true` if offline messages are supported, otherwise can be `false`.

Alternative method is to use [`shh_newMessageFilter`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_newmessagefilter) which takes the same criteria object and then periodically calling [`shh_getFilterMessages`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper-v6-RPC-API#shh_getfiltermessages) method.

# Group messages

TODO: describe how to send a group message starting from adding a key in Whisper etc.

# Offline messages

In the case of mobile clients which are often offline, there is a strong need to have an ability to download offline messages. By offline messages, we mean messages sent into the Whisper network and expired before being collected by the recipient. A message stays in the Whisper network for a duration specified as `TTL` (time-to-live) property.

A Whisper client needs to register a mail server instance which will be used by [geth's Whisper service](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/v1.8.23/whisper/whisperv6/whisper.go#L209-L213).

`MailServer` is an interface with two methods:
* `Archive(env *Envelope)`
* `DeliverMail(whisperPeer *Peer, request *Envelope)`

If a mail server is registered for a given Whisper client, it will save all incoming messages on a local disk (this is the simplest implementation, it can store the messages wherever it wants, also using technologies like swarm and IPFS) in the background.

Notice that each node is meant to be independent and SHOULD keep a copy of all historic messages. High Availability (HA) can be achieved by having multiple nodes in different locations. Additionally, each node is free to store messages in a way which provides storage HA as well.

Saved messages are delivered to a requester (another Whisper peer) asynchronously as a response to `p2pMessageCode` message code. This is not exposed as a JSON-RPC method in `shh` namespace but it's exposed in status-go as `shhext_requestMessages` and blocking `shh_requestMessagesSync`. Read more about [Whisper V6 extensions](#whisper-v6-extensions-or-status-whisper-node).

In order to receive historic messages from a filter, p2p messages MUST be allowed when creating the filter. Receiving p2p messages is implemented in [geth's Whisper V6 implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/v1.8.23/whisper/whisperv6/whisper.go#L739-L751).

## Anonymity concerns

In order to use a mail server, a given node needs to connect to it directly, i.e. add the mail server as its peer and mark it as trusted. This means that the mail server is able to send direct p2p messages to the node instead of broadcasting them. Effectively, it knows which topics the node is interested in, when it is online as well as many metadata like IP address.

# Whisper V6 extensions (or Status Whisper Node)

Protocol's target is to be compliant with [the Whisper V6 Specification](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper). It should not matter which implementation is used as long as the implementation follow the Whisper V6 Specification.

However, we added a few extensions, message codes and RPC methods to the Whisper V6 service in order to provide better user experience or due to efficiency requirements.

All described addons are implemented in [status-im/whisper fork](https://github.com/status-im/whisper).

## New RPC methods

TODO: provide a list of RPC methods from `shhext` API which are relevant to this spec.


## Raw SoK message evaluation

*TODO: Write this in a more active voice and with a better structure.**

## Transport privacy

The transport privacy layer defines how messages are exchanged. The goal is to hide metadata such as sender, receiver and to which conversation a message belongs.

This evaluates Whisper as a standalone protocol. However, we also note common usage and Status specific usage.

- [EIP-627, aka Whisper v6](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-627)
- [Whisper PoC 2 spec (more motivation)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper-PoC-2-Protocol-Spec)

### --- Privacy

#### Sender Anonymity (PARTIAL)
> When a chat message is received, no non-global entities except for the sender can determine which entity produced the message.

- Generally speaking, a peer can't tell if a neighbor is the message originator.

- However, since the "signature" of an envelope doesn't change, this means a Global Passive Adversary can watch a packet as it traverses the network.

- Additionally, being fully surrounded by cooperating adversarial nodes breaks this. This is similar to an eclipse attack, since these nodes can cooperate and distinguish between relaying messages and new messages.

- Light clients that don't repeat traffic will leave more obvious metadata trail.

- Using a mix format would partially mitigate this, e.g. [Sphinx](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf)

- Moot account
    - All messages are signed by (identity) private key that can be generated at will, which provides pseudonymity.  The Moot account is a shared key.  The more people that use it, the larger the anonymity set is. 
    - potential for hard coding it into app for increasing its anonymity set

#### Recipient Anonymity (YES)
> No non-global entities except the receiver of a chat message know which entity received it.

- One caveat is that if you listen to too specialized topics you might give up too much information. This is a trade-off with bandwidth consumption.

- 1:1 chats are currently under one topic, but will be partitioned (somehow)
    - ask Roman [IGOR: partitioning was implemented, a few topics are generated from each user's public keys]

- We are working with an optional ACK message to verify receipt of message
   * [IGOR] only from mailservers

- The various types of chat we provide right now are:
    - 1:1 chat
    - Private group chat
    - Public chats

- Since Whisper is broadcast based, we use topics for this. This ensures the bandwidth usage is somewhat more manageable, trading off darkness.

- Public chats are hashed to a topic. Then we have a special discovery topic, which we use to coordinate further topics. E.g. for group chat there's a a secret, random topic that's agreed upon for further communication. 1:1 currently uses discovery topic, but you can either partition this or use things like topic ratcheting. This is at the expense of some more coordination, similar to how you generate a shared secret key.

#### Participant Anonymity (YES)
> No non-global entities except the conversation participants can discover which set of network nodes are engaged in a conversation

- See Conversation Security

#### Unlinkability (YES)

> No non-global entities except the conversation participants can discover that two protocol messages belong to the same conversation.

- Since it is broadcast based, there's no unique recipient.

- (This might change depending on topic usage).

#### Global Adversary Resistant (NO)
> Global adversaries cannot break the anonymity of the protocol

- Sender anonymity is broken if an envelope has a unique signature, as well as in the above mentioned eclipse-like attack.

### --- Usability

#### Contact Discovery (YES)

> The system provides a mechanism for discovering contact information.

- A "contact" identifier in Whisper is a public-key.  You can get this via a few methods
    - out of band 
    - in-band in a public chat
    - ENS naming scheme

- Assuming you have a public key, you can contact them.

##### Notes
For a mixnet based approach, see e.g. https://github.com/w3f/messaging/issues/22

#### No Message Delays (YES)
> No long message delays are incurred.

- No real time communication but assuming reasonable node connectivity the number of relays is a low constant.

#### No Message Drops (NO)
> No Message Drops: Dropped messages are retransmitted.

- Whisper messages have a TTL

- With Whisper mailserver extensions expired messages can be received through a direct TCP connection over some timeframe.

#### Easy Initialization (YES)
> The user does not need to perform any significant tasks before starting to communicate.

- True.

#### No Fees Required (YES)
> The scheme does not require monetary fees to be used.

- True.

[Igor: how does that matches with Network Incentivization? Woudn't it break this?]

### --- Adoption

#### Topology independent (YES)
> No network topology is imposed on the conversation security or trust establishment schemes

- The topology has no impact on the security of the network

##### Notes 
-https://github.com/w3f/messaging/issues/12


#### No Additional Services (YES*)
> The architecture does not depend on availability of any infrastructure beyond the chat participants.

- Technically nothing breaks if only the participants are relaying Whisper messages, but some of the security assumptions are based on a broader userbase

#### Spam/Flood Resistant (PARTIAL)
> The availability of the system is resistant to denial-of-service attacks and bulk messaging

- Proof of work produces a nonce based on payload and TTL. However, this doesn't take heterogenerous devices into account.

- For Status this is a NO since PoW is set arbitrarily low.

#### Low Storage (NO)
> The system does not require a large amount of storage capacity for any entity

- Entities receive messages they don't "need". However, there's no requirement for individual nodes to keep messages or write to disk.

- Storage requirement of entire network of N nodes for M messages can be up to M*TTL*N.

#### Low Bandwidth (NO)
> The system does not require a large amount of bandwidth usage for any entity.

- You receive messages you don't need, by relaying, also redundantly.

- It's a flood-like network.

- Use of bloom filters and partial relaying (light mode of operation) reduces this somewhat, at the expense of weaker privacy guarantees.

##### Notes

- Compare redundant messages in Whisper vs PSS: https://status.im/research/whisper_pss.html

#### Low Computation (NO)
> The system does not require a large amount of processing power for any entity

- Must attempt to decrypt every message received on the network, also must provide PoW to send

#### Asynchronous (NO)
> Messages sent to recipients who are offline will be delivered when the recipient reconnects, even if the sender has since disconnected.

- There's a TTL for each message.

- As an extension, there's a Whisper mailserver that resend messages on demand to trusted peers. However, this happens outside of the normal Whisper transport through a direct TCP connection. [Andrea: I am not sure this is accurate, first whisper uses TCP and direct connections to any peer (through devp2p). the request happens at the devp2p channel, which is the one whisper uses to communicate, and the sending of envelopes is not much different from other peers, although this envelopes are different (might be expired, but we accept them as the peer is trusted), but the mailserver is a peer (although a trusted one) Dshulyak can help out to confirm, but it seems that the point is debatable]

#### Scalable (NO)
> The amount of resources required to maintain system availability scales linearly with the number of users.

- It's :whale: worse than linear, as every additional user must carry the load of all other users.

- The trade-off of partitioning the network is losing security around dark routing of messages.

- This trade-off appears suboptimal.
