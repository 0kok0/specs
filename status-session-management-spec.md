## Introduction

A peer is identified by two pieces of data:

1) An `installation-id` which is generated upon creating a new account in the `Status` application
2) Their identity whisper key

## Initialization

A new session is initialized once a successful X3DH exchange has taken place. Subsequent messages will use the established session until re-keying is necessary.

## Concurrent sessions

If two sessions are created concurrently between two peers the one with the symmetric key first in byte order SHOULD be used, this marks that the other has expired.

## Re-keying

On receiving a bundle from a given peer with a higher version, the old bundle SHOULD be marked as expired and a new session SHOULD be established on the next message sent.

## Multi-device support

Multi-device support is quite challenging as we don't have a central place where information on which and how many devices (identified by their respective `installation-id`) belongs to a whisper-identity.

Furthermore we always need to take account recovery in consideration, where the whole device is wiped clean and all the information about any previous sessions is lost.

Taking these considerations into account, the way multi-device information is propagated through the network is through x3dh bundles, which will contain information about paired devices as well as information about the sending device.

This mean that every time a new device is paired, the bundle needs to be updated and propagated with the new information, and the burden is put on the user to make sure the pairing is successful.

The method is loosely based on https://signal.org/docs/specifications/sesame/ .

<!-- TODO: This multi device section isn't clear enough -->
<!-- TODO: Additionally, it seems tightly coupled with secure transport, which makes things like multi device public chats harder to reason about (IMO). E.g. as a client impl I might want multi device support but not want to impl double ratchet etc, so what does this mean? -->
<!-- It is coupled to the secure transport because otherwise there's no need of multidevice. Without a secure transport multi-device is trivial (nothing to implement, such in public chats, nothing to reason about), the type of secure transport we use dictates the type of multi-device support we want, same as signal's "Sesame was designed for use with Double Ratchet sessions created via X3DH key agreement.". Please read the specs of sesame, it clearly shows that it's tightly coupled to the encryption layer and its purpose is to allow encrypting messages for multiple devices, such in our case. Let's take some time understanding and reading things before commenting. -->

## Pairing

When a user adds a new account in the `Status` application, a new `installation-id` will be generated. The device should be paired as soon as possible if other devices are present. Once paired the contacts will be notified of the new device and it will be included in further communications.

Any time a bundle from your `IK` but different `installation-id` is received, the device will be shown to the user and will have to be manually approved, to a maximum of 3. Once that is done any message sent by one device will also be sent to any other enabled device.

Once a new device is enabled, a new bundle will be generated which will include pairing information.

The bundle will be propagated to contacts through the usual channels.

Removal of paired devices is a manual step that needs to be applied on each device, and consist simply in disabling the device, at which point pairing information will not be propagated anymore.

## Sending messages to a paired group

When sending a message, the peer will send a message to any `installation-id` that they have seen, using pairwise encryption, including their own devices.

The number of devices is capped to 3, ordered by last activity.

## Account recovery

Account recovery is no different from adding a new device, and it is handled in exactly the same way.

## Partitioned devices

In some cases (i.e. account recovery when no other pairing device is available, device not paired), it is possible that a device will receive a message that is not targeted to its own `installation-id`.
In this case an empty message containing bundle information is sent back, which will notify the receiving end of including this device in any further communication.

## Trust establishment

Trust establishment deals with users verifying they are communicating with who they think they are.
