# Conversational Security Layer

# Transport privacy layer

The purpose of the transport privacy layer is to hide metadata (provide darkness) that are always sent when communicating over the internet. In some cases, leaked metadata might be as dangerous as leaking the actual payload so it's important to reduce that.

The Status Protocol uses [Whisper in version 6](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper) as a privacy protection protocol. Whisper routes messages by broadcasting them to all connected peers so that identifying of the recipient is almost impossible (the sender is not equally protected, though). [Read more](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Achieving-Darkness) about how Whisper achieves darkness.

Note: there is one more cross-layer dependency in the Status Protocol between the privacy and data layers. Whisper uses topics to reduce traffic and preliminarily filter out messages. However, selecting a topic depends on the type of the message that is a topic for 1-1 chat will be different from a topic for a public chat.

Please refer to [Initial Transport Privacy through Whisper Specification](x7.md) for more details.
