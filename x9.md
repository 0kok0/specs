# Status Account Creation and Maintenance Specification

## Summary

The core concept of an account in Status is a set of cryptographic keypairs.  Namely, the combination of the following:
1. a whisper chat identity keypair
1. a set of cryptocurrency wallet keypairs

Everything else associated with the contact is either verified or derived from the above items, including:
- Ethereum address (future verification, currently the same base keypair)
- 3 word mnemonic name
- identicon
- message signatures

## 1 Initial Key Generation
### 1.1 Public/Private Keypairs 
- An ECDSA (secp256k1 curve) public/private keypair MUST be generated via a [BIP43](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki) derived path from a [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) mnemonic seed phrase.
- The default paths are defined as such:
    - Whisper Chat Key ($IK$): `m/43'/60'/1581'/0'/0`  (post Multiaccount integration)
        - following [EIP1581](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1581.md)
    - DB encryption Key ($DBK$): `m/43'/60'/1581'/1'/0` (post Multiaccount integration)
        - following [EIP1581](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1581.md)
    - Status Wallet paths: `m/44'/60'/0'/0'/i` starting at `i=0`
        - following [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)
        - NOTE: this (`i=0`) is also the current (and only) path for Whisper key before Multiaccount integration

### 1.2 X3DH Prekey bundle creation
- A client must create an amount of X3DH prekey bundles, each defined by the following items:
    - Identity Key: $IK$
    - Signed prekey: $SPK$
    - Prekey signature: $Sig(IK, \text{Encode}(SPK)$)
    - one-time prekey: $OPK$ (???? need this?)

## 2 Account Broadcasting
- A user is responsible for broadcasting certain information publicly so that others may contact them.

### 2.1 X3DH Prekey bundles
- A client [MUST/SHOULD] regenerate a group of X3DH prekey bundles every 24 hours and broadcast them through the appropriate channels 

## 3 Optional Account additions
### 3.1 ENS Username
- A user MAY register a public username on the Ethereum Name System (ENS).  This username is a user-chosen subdomain of the `stateofus.eth` ENS registration that maps to their whisper identity key ($IK$). 
    - TODO: verify if this is contact code or public key

### 3.2 User Chosen Name
- An account MAY create a display name to replace the $IK$ generated 3-word pseudonym in chat screens.  This chosen display name will become part of the publicly broadcasted profile of the account.

### 3.3 User Profile Picture
- An account MAY edit the $IK$ generated identicon with a chosen picture.  This picture will become part of the publicly broadcasted profile of the account.

### 3.4 Tribute to Talk
- TODO - Couched until later

### 3.5 Wallet Accounts
- TODO (based in multiaccount)
